# Machine Problem 1 - TRUTH TABLE GENERATOR

One of the most common topics discussed in logic is making truth tables. While logic is
discussed commonly in mathematical terms, it constitutes an intricate foundation for logic
gates, which include the XNOR, XOR gates, and the like. In fact, every line of code in every
function in every application always includes the use of such logic gates!

In this machine problem, you will construct a truth table generator that outputs a truth
table for a certain statement.

# User Input

For the statements, you will use P and Q, True, and False. You are free to create your own
desired statement format. Some suggested formats include “P AND Q”, “P ^ Q”, “P A Q”,
etc. Whichever format you use, please indicate them in your documentation. You can utilize
creating a String variable that stores the user input.

# Truth Table Format

• Individual: In generating your truth tables, you are only required to print the required
logical variables and constants (e.g. P, Q, True, False) along with the result of the logical
statement.
• Group: In generating the truth table, you are required to print additional columns that
represent the full computation of the logical statement.

NOTE: You are NOT allowed to use any existing functions (if any) that can print truth tables
or compute logical statements immediately, nor copy-pasting the documentation of the said
functions.

# Documentation Format

Your documentation shall include the following:
• Introduction – brief description of your program
• Description of Variables Used
• How It Works / Algorithm (Flowchart or Pseudo-Code)
• Error Handling
• User’s Manual

# File Format

All your files shall be zipped in a folder named Surname_MP1 for individual outputs, and
Surname1_Surname2_..._MP1 for group outputs. Your zipped files must contain the
following:
• Documentation
• Your coding file (can be C, C++, or Java)
• Screenshots of sample outputs

# Bonuses

Bonuses shall be offered for the following situations:
• +5% if an additional logical variable is added (R)
• +10% if you’ve used Python as your programming language
• +5% if you’ve utilized reading files for input (use input.txt for file reading)
• +2% per day for early submissions (MAX 10%)

# Penalties

Deductions will be incurred for the following situations:
• -100% if the code is not working at all (includes unable to run due to syntax errors)
• -5% per day for late submissions
• -50% if your group feedback is significantly low compared to other members

# Additional Notes

• Groups shall be comprised of 4-5 members.
• Any updates shall be discussed in class and amended in this doc ASAP at the MVLE.
